## Description

_This website was created to play Tic-Tac-Toe._

The goal of this project was to create a smart Tic-Tac-Toe bot that made all the correct decisions based off of the strategy section in the Wikipedia page for Tic-Tac-Toe: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe.  There is lots of room for refactoring since much of the code is unnecessarily repeated.   

## Specs

1. Create the board with 2 dimensional arrays.
  Example: array = [ [3],[3],[3] ]

2. Create a constructor for the player, Space, Board, and Game.
  Example: function Player (name, points, x or o)

3. Add click listeners to each cell on the board.
  Example: X appears when box is clicked.

4. Alternate between X and O also between player 1 and player 2.
  Example: When cell is clicked either X or O will change.

5. Create branch statements to determine who will win.
  Example: When three symbols in a row display winner and ends game.
